# Sayed 3 key Insights from the Conversation

## 1. Taking Ownership of Problems
One important thing I learned from this conversation is that a data engineer should take ownership of problems. Instead of just reporting an issue or passing it to someone else, the engineer should try to understand where the problem comes from and help fix it. This showed me the difference between a technician and an engineer.

## 2. Importance of Monitoring Data Systems
The conversation helped me realize that many system or “internet” issues are actually related to data flow. Data might be missing, delayed, or incorrect. Because of this, monitoring data pipelines and understanding how data moves through systems is very important for a data engineer.

## 3. Preventing Repeated Issues
Another insight is that solving a problem once is not enough. For issues that happen repeatedly, it is better to document them and create a standard way to detect and fix them. This can save time and help teams respond faster in the future.
